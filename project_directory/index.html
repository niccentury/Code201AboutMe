        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p class="transStory">I was born in a little town just 20 minutes south of Montgomery, AL called Hayneville, AL.
            As a child I played a lot in the wood surrounding my parents property which taught me a lot about the outdoors and how
            to appreciate it. After my father died when I was 12 I moved to Auburn, AL to finish out my school years.
            After finishing high school I moved to Seattle, WA on June 12, 2012. I came here for no particulary reason other
            than to visit my uncle who I had'nt seen in 12 years at the time. Being a young man coming from the south I found Seattle
            rather weird and awkward, but this place did have a lot to offer me.
            <br> Shortly after moving to Seattle I started college at Seattle Central where I met most of the friends I have today.
            It was a very hard transition from a simple life back to the fast paced life in the city trying to balance work and school.
            Aside from it being difficult it was also very interesting to see new things and meet new people in my time there. now I am putting myself to the test by becoming apart of code follows and trying to grow as much as I can while I am here as well.
